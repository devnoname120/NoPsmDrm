# NoPsmDrm Plugin by Frangarcj

## Features
- Exports PSM content license keys as fake licences.
- Bypasses expiration of PSM game licenses.
- Allows sharing PSM content across multiple PS Vita accounts and devices using generated fake license files.

In a nutshell, this plugin allows you to bypass DRM protection on PSM game content.

### This software WILL NOT
- Allow modifications to your games/applications.
- Enable you to run PSM content without a valid license or a fake license file.

### WARNING !!!
- For those with valid PSM activated Vitas and licenses, **BACKUP EVERYTHING inside tm0 and ux0:/psm**  before using this plugin. If there's no backup and some files get removed / erased there is no way to get them back

## Legal Disclaimer
- The removal and distribution of DRM content and/or circumventing copy protection mechanisms for any other purpose than archiving/preserving games you own licenses for is illegal.  
- This software is meant to be strictly reserved for your own **PERSONAL USE**.
- The author does not take any responsibility for your actions using this software.

## Software Requirements
This software will only work on PlayStation Vita, PlayStation Vita TV, PlayStation TV devices running on firmware 3.60, the taiHEN framework and HENkaku need to be running on your device, for more information please connect to https://henkaku.xyz/  

## Installation
Download the latest [nopsmdrm.skprx](https://github.com/frangarcj/NoPsmDrm/releases), copy it to `ux0:tai` and modify the `ux0:tai/config.txt` file to add the path to the module under `*KERNEL` as follows

```
*KERNEL
ux0:tai/nopsmdrm.skprx
```

If you know what you are doing, you may change this path to an arbitrary location as long as it matches the exact location of the module. 
You may also edit the `ur0:tai/config.txt` instead assuming you do not have a config.txt file inside the `ux0:tai/` folder

## Creating the fake license
In order to generate a fake license file containing the application's keys, you must first launch the application with the NoPsmDrm plugin enabled.  
The fake licenses for the applications will then be stored at
- `ux0:data/EM0041-NPOA00013_00-0000000000000000.rif` using content id as filename

## Sharing PSM Games
- If you wish to use the application on the same device but on a different account, simply copy the fake license `ux0:data/EM0041-NPOA00013_00-0000000000000000.rif` to
  `ux0:psm/NPOA00013/RO/License/FAKE.rif`.
- If you wish to use the application on a different device, transfer the content of `ux0:psm/TITLE_ID` to your PC and copy the fake license `ux0:data/EM0041-NPOA00013_00-0000000000000000.rif` file as `ux0:psm/TITLE_ID/RO/License/FAKE.rif` **You need to update / rebuild database**

## Installing shared games
- PSM games must be stored at the following location: `ux0:psm/TITLE_ID`
- You must update / rebuild database
